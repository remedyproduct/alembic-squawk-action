# This script:
# 1. Reads a list of changed Alembic migration files from an environment variable "FILE_NAMES".
# 2. Uses Alembicâ€™s internal API to load and sort all known migrations.
# 3. Determines the earliest and latest changed migrations in the topological order.
# 4. Outputs the Alembic upgrade range in the format "start_revision:end_revision".
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Ensure that an alembic.ini file is present and properly configured.
# - The changed migration files should be inside the configured "versions" directory.
#
# If no changed migrations are found, or no valid range can be computed, outputs nothing.
